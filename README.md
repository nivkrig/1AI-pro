# CNN project final version
### This is the completely operational version of a previous CNN project that used the mnist dataset to clasify digits. 
### OpenCV immages were not closing and would end up making the python files unresponsive so I decided to use matplotlib to display the images.
### This project was inspired by servral different tutorials online however the original tutorial, that used the LeCunn structure, I cannot find anymore.
