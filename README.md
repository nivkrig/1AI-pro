# CNN project final version
#### This is the completely operational version of a previous CNN project that used the mnist dataset to clasify digits. 
#### OpenCV immages were not closing and would end up making the python files unresponsive so I decided to use matplotlib to display the images.
#### This project was inspired by servral different tutorials online however the original tutorial, that used the LeCunn structure, I cannot find anymore. 
#### I decided to use one epoch, mostly becuase it reaches %90 accuracy, but also to save time training, however the model does increase in accuracy with further training.
#### For now I am using same Mnist data to manualy test the imported model, I might look to finding alternate data to use in the future.<img width="936" alt="Screen Shot 2023-12-12 at 9 05 57 PM" src="https://github.com/nivkrig/1AI-pro/assets/86209884/7c1822f5-b89b-4d8c-8165-af660a0a3df6">
